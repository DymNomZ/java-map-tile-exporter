## A basic tile exporter for developing maps for 2D games.

**Information:**<br>

It exports to a .zip file, which contains the following files:
- A list of images used when creating the map/level.
- **[map name]$.txt**
- This stores the indices of each tile used. Most implementations utilize this file when loading tiles of their maps.
- **tile_data.txt**
- Columns represent index, solid, and animated, respectively, with 1 being true and 0 as false for solid and animated values.

‚ùó**Instructions:**

**Set an index for each tile**<br>
The default is 0. Leaving the index as is will render it void.<br>
**Use different indexes for each tile**<br>
Having tiles with the same indices will cause conflicts. Only the first tile with the same index will be read.<br>
For now, you are responsible for keeping track of the latest index. I may or may not add a feature to increment an index automatically.<br>
