**Instructions:**<br>
- When loading tiles, set an index for each tile. Forgetting to do so will count the tile as void.<br>
- Use different indices for each tile. Only the first tile with the same index will be read.

**Controls:** <br>
- left-click = place/remove tile | Click a tile to select/deselect it, deselecting will allow you to remove tiles.<br>
- right-click = drag grid<br>
- middle-click = toggle paint mode
- mouse-wheel = zoom

‚ùó**Instructions:**

**Set an index for each tile**<br>
The default is 0. Leaving the index as is will render it void.<br>
**Use different indexes for each tile**<br>
Having tiles with the same indices will cause conflicts. Only the first tile with the same index will be read.<br>
For now, you are responsible for keeping track of the latest index. I may or may not add a feature to increment an index automatically.<br>
